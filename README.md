This project states my Master's thesis program. 
We investigate potential recursion patterns on optimal complete graph drawings by applying a combinatorial cluster algorithm. A version of Lloyd's algorithm.
In Figs folder, you may see the performance of clustering optimal graph drawings. The main code is in clusterordtype.py file.
